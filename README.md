AI Bias Detection and Mitigation Framework for Recruitment Systems

Built a complete, production-ready tool that:
• Detects gender, race, and age bias in hiring ML models
• Uses industry-standard fairness metrics (Disparate Impact, Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity)
• Applies Reweighing mitigation (AIF360) → improves fairness while keeping accuracy loss < 2%
• Includes interactive Gradio demo so clients can test predictions live
• Full business impact section + compliance notes (EEOC 4/5th rule, GDPR, EU AI Act)

Tech stack: Python, scikit-learn, AIF360, Pandas, Matplotlib, Gradio

Dataset: UCI Adult Income (standard proxy for hiring decisions)

This is exactly the kind of audit I deliver for clients who need ethical AI + regulatory compliance.
